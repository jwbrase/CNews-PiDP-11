PiDP-11 release of C News, version 1.1.0-jwb			July 2020

This release can be obtained from my github repository at <https://www.github.com/jwbrase>. 
I also have a copy of the original Cleanup Release with patch CR.G sources, which I
originally obtained from:

<https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Applications/News/C-News/Apr_1995_Release/c-news.tar.Z>.

See README.changes for what's changed since patch CR.G, README.install for
installation instructions and a pointer to my installation howto, and 
README.etc for general notes. The documentation in doc/ was apparently out of
date as of CR.G, but the changes I've made are relatively minor, so the 
documentation shouldn't be much more out of date than it was 25 years ago :-).

The original text of the README file from CR.G follows after the dashes below.
Obviously, the instructions there for obtaining C-News are going to be long
out of date, see the github and tuhs.org links above.
