/* The patch in the PiDP-11-patch directory, which contains the changes between the
 * c-news-orig directory and the PiDP-11-release directory is (c) Jon Brase 2020.
 * It remains under the same terms as the original code. The original contents of the
 * COPYRIGHT file are included unchanged below the dashed line, and in the COPYRIGHT file 
 * in the c-news-orig directory. The original terms request, but do not require that the
 * sponsorship information in the README and the sponsors directory be retained.
 * As 25 years have elapsed, and ClariNet is defunct while UUNET has been absorbed by
 * Verizon, I have opted not to retain this sponsorship information in the PiDP-11-release
 * directory. It is retained in the c-news-orig directory, as that is a verbatim copy of
 * the original C-news sources.
